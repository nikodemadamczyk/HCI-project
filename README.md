## üìã Project Overview

This project was developed based on client conversations and requirements for a new course management system at Space University. The implementation focuses on creating a user-friendly interface that meets the specific needs identified during client meetings.

### Key Requirements from Client Conversation

   - Course enrollment for students
   - Schedule viewing with room information
   - Basic profile management

3. **Technical Constraints**
   - Desktop-only interface (as specified)
   - No backend integration required
   - Focus on frontend design and user experience

## üé® Design System

Based on the client's branding requirements, the interface uses:

```css
/* Primary Colors */
--primary-dark: #00060D     /* Rich Black */
--primary-navy: #151C4C     /* Navy Blue */
